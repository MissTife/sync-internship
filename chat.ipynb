            "Chatbot: Skincare for oily skin aims to control excess oil production, prevent breakouts, and maintain a balanced complexion. The goal is to keep the skin clean and well-moisturized without exacerbating oiliness. Here's a tailored skincare routine for oily skin:\n",
            "1. Cleansing: Use a gentle, foaming cleanser specifically designed for oily or acne-prone skin. Cleansers with ingredients like salicylic acid or glycolic acid can help control oil and unclog pores.\n",
            "2. Exfoliation: Exfoliate 2-3 times a week to remove dead skin cells and prevent clogged pores. Look for chemical exfoliants with ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs).\n",
            "3. Toning: Choose an alcohol-free toner that contains ingredients like witch hazel or tea tree oil, which can help balance oil production and soothe the skin.\n",
            "4. Lightweight Moisturizer: Even oily skin needs hydration, but opt for a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer or gel-based formula. Look for products labeled as non-comedogenic to prevent pore clogging.\n",
            "5. Sunscreen: Always apply a lightweight, non-greasy sunscreen with at least SPF 30 before going outdoors. Look for oil-free or gel-based sunscreens.\n",
            "6. Oil-Free Makeup: If you use makeup, choose oil-free or matte formulations. Mineral-based makeup can be a good option for oily skin as well.\n",
            "7. Blotting Papers: Keep blotting papers handy throughout the day to absorb excess oil without disturbing your makeup.\n",
            "8. Avoid Harsh Ingredients: Avoid harsh or heavy skincare products that can strip the skin and trigger more oil production. Stay away from products containing alcohol or high levels of fragrance.\n",
            "9. Clay Masks: Use a clay mask once a week to help absorb excess oil and reduce the appearance of large pores.\n",
            "10. Hydration: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, as dehydrated skin can sometimes overcompensate by producing more oil.\n",
            "11. Avoid Touching Your Face: Avoid touching your face with your hands, as it can transfer oils and dirt and potentially lead to breakouts.\n",
            "12. Consistency: Stick to your skincare routine consistently to see the best results. It may take time for your skin to adjust and show improvement.\n",
            "Remember that everyone's skin is different, so it's essential to pay attention to how your skin responds to different products and adjust your routine accordingly. If you have specific skin concerns or persistent acne issues, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment.\n",
